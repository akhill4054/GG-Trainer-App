# Hand Gesture Translator App
Android (Kotlin) app that translates hand gestures to speech using an SVM model. <br>
It connects via Bluetooth to a sensor device (accelerometer and gyroscope) to capture hand and finger movements. <br>
A Python Django backend processes the data, performs translations, and allows users to train the model with custom gestures.
